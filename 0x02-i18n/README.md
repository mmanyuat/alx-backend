The objective of learning Flask-Babel is to enable developers to add robust internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) features to Flask applications, enhancing the user experience by supporting multiple languages and cultural formats. Through this learning, developers will:

1. Understand core concepts of i18n and l10n in web development.
2. Implement date, time, and number formatting according to users' language and regional settings, ensuring culturally appropriate displays.
3. Manage translations by marking translatable strings, creating translation files, and configuring Babel for multiple languages.
4. Dynamically adapt to users' preferred languages and timezones using custom selectors.
5. Gain proficiency with Babel tools such as `pybabel` for extracting, compiling, and updating translations.

By mastering Flask-Babel, developers will be able to build globally 
accessible applications that automatically adjust content to user locales, 
improving accessibility and engagement in international markets.
