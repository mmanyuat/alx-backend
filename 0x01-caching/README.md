Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing several common cache replacement policies, including:

FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
LRU (Least Recently Used)
MRU (Most Recently Used)
LFU (Least Frequently Used)
Each caching class inherits from a base caching class (BaseCaching) 
and contains methods for adding and retrieving items from the cache. 
The primary objective is to explore how each policy affects cache behavior under different constraints.
